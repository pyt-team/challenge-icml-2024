Since we are lifting graphs to combinatorial complexes (CC), we implemented the path lifting approach from [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04916). We first briefly recall some of the definitions we employed in this notebook from [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00606). Combinatorial complex (CC) constitute a higher-order domain that can be viewed from three perspectives: \n",
    "- as a simplicial complex whose cells and simplices are allowed to be missing;\n",
    "- as a generalized cell complex with relaxed structure;\n",

For instance, the incorporation of rank-2 cells onto a graph, transforming it into a combinatorial complex, represents a lifting procedure.
