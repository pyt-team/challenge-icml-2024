    r"""Lifts graphs to a simplicial complex domain by considering line simplicial complex.

    Line simplicial complex is a clique complex of the line graph. Line graph is a graph, in which
    the vertices are the edges in the initial graph, and two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding
    edges are adjacent in the initial graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    **kwargs : optional
        Additional arguments for the class.
